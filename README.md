This project presents a dynamic simulation of digital holography that models both object motion and camera oscillation in a Fresnel diffraction framework. A grayscale image is treated as a complex object field and subjected to controlled translation, rotation, and scaling over time, simulating physical movement. Simultaneously, the virtual camera plane oscillates along the optical axis, introducing depth variation in the hologram formation process.
At each time step, the object field is numerically propagated to the sensor plane using a Fresnel transfer function. A reference wave — either on-axis or off-axis — interferes with the propagated object wave to produce a time-varying hologram. Reconstruction is performed by back-propagating the recorded intensity using the conjugate transfer function, yielding a dynamic view of the recovered object field.
The simulation visualizes three panels per frame: the moving object’s intensity, the simulated hologram, and the reconstructed image. All frames are compiled into an animated GIF, offering a compelling visualization of wavefront evolution, interference, and inverse imaging under motion. This project demonstrates advanced skills in wave optics, numerical modeling, and scientific animation, and serves as a powerful educational and research tool in computational imaging and digital holography.
